# Key phrase extraction

Repository for me to learn about key phrase extraction algorithm.
I use tf-idf weighting in order to rank key phrases candidate.
Materials are mainly borrowed from this [blog](http://bdewilde.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/intro-to-automatic-keyphrase-extraction/).

You can run example as follows

```
$ python keyphrase_extraction.py
```

## Dependencies

- nltk
- scikit-learn
- unidecode
- pandas (optional for example)
